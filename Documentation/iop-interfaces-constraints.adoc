==== Size of application queries ====

For performance and security reasons, queries must stay below a 2 MB limit.
The platform will ignore requests with larger query sizes.

==== Size of responses towards applications ====

To find a fair trade-off between the responses size, network latencies and
batch processing, we will limit the responses useful payload to 10 MB.
Some additional data could be associated to the payload depending on
the encoding (JSON or XML). Thus the overall responses could be slightly
over 10 MB from a few kilobytes.
