==== Size of application queries ====

For performance and security reasons, queries must stay below a 2 MB limit.
The platform will ignore requests with larger query sizes.

==== Size of responses towards applications ====

So that our products find a fair trade-off between the responses size, network
latencies and batch processing, applications should perform queries that limit
the responses useful payload to 20 MB.

There is no strict check about it, but this is a good practice that should
be respected.
