Addresses are not strictly speaking objects per se, but are just a field of
type "string". The syntax is strict and accepts the following three
alternatives:

`"a.b.c.d:port"`::
  `a.b.c.d` must be a valid ipv4 IP address. For example:
  `"10.0.0.1:1234"`.
`"[ipv6addr]:port"`::
  `ipv6addr` must be a valid ipv6 IP address. For example:
  `"[2001:abcd::1]:1234"`.
`"fqdn.tld:port"`::
  `fqdn.tld` must be a valid fully qualified domain name. Adresses will be
  resolved only once on startup, using the OS resolver
  settingsfootnote:[This means that the lookup is done using the Posix
  `getaddrinfo(3)` call, using the `AF_UNSPEC` hint. The choice between
  IPv6 and IPv4 depends on the OS settings. Please see the OS Vendor
  manual for details as, for example, the `gai.conf(5)` manual page for
  glibc based systems.]. For example: `"host1.example.com:1234"`.

Note that the port is never optional, and the lack of it will result in
an error.
