Platform 'HTTP/1.1' support as a server is complete, including features like
`Expect: 100- continue' or pipelining. Though, unlike what the <<HTTP_1.1>>
standard mandates, the server doesn't support 'HTTP/0.9' requests. It is
to be noted that whereas 'HTTP/1.0' is supported, due to its lack of support
for pipelining and chunked encoding, using 'HTTP/1.0' may yield bad overall
performance.

Our HTTP interfaces support:

-  Pipelining.
-  Garbage collecting of unused connections after a configurable delay;
-  Automatic recycling of connections after a configurable amount of requests;
-  Basic HTTP Authentication (If security is required, use HTTPS);
-  HTTPS/TLS server (certificates and keys are in PEM format);
-  Content encodings (identity, gzip and deflate).
