/* IOP² - An IOP-based library for IOP generation.
 *
 * Tools for dynamic generation of usable IOP content.
 *
 *  iopsq.Package ── 1 ──→ iopc_pkg_t ── 2,3 ──→ iop_pkg_t
 *
 * 1. Building of an iopc package from an IOP² package. The code is in
 *    iopc-iopsq.c and it works in a similar way as iopc-parser.
 *    The package can refer to types from IOP environment: builtin IOP types
 *    can be used and have the expected pointer value (&foo__bar__s).
 *
 * 2. Resolution of IOP types with iopc-typer.
 *
 * 3. Generation of an IOP C package description. The code is in iopc-lang-c.c
 *    because it does quite the same as the code generator except that it
 *    directly generates the structures. This is the part that uses the
 *    provided memory pool.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *
 *    - Default values: default values exist in iopsq.iop and are correctly
 *    transformed at step 1., but not at step 3 (yet).
 *
 *    - Not supported yet: classes, attributes, modules, interfaces, typedefs,
 *    RPCs, SNMP objects.
 *
 *    - Typedefs from IOPs loaded to the environment cannot be used by
 *    refering to them with "typeName" like for the other types because
 *    typedefs cease to exist in packge descriptions iop_pkg_t, so they are
 *    missing in the IOP environment too.
 *
 *    - Dynamic transformation of IOP syntax (mypackage.iop) into IOP
 *    description without having to create a DSO: already possible but no
 *    helper is provided to do that. The step 3. should be protected against
 *    unsupported features first, because for now, most of them would be
 *    silently ignored.
 *
 *   - No tool to "extract" an IOP² description of an IOP type for now. This
 *   feature could be useful for versioning and migration of IOP objects.
 *
 *   - Sub-packages and multi-package loading.
