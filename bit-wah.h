/** \defgroup qkv__ll__wah Word Aligned Hybrid bitmaps.
 * \ingroup qkv__ll
 * \brief Word Aligned Hybrid bitmaps.
 *
 * \{
 *
 * WAH are a form of compressed bitmap highly compact in case the bitmap
 * contains a lot of successive bits at the same value (1 or 0). In that case,
 * the sequence is compressed as a single integer containing the number of
 * words (32bits) of the sequence.
 *
 * \section format WAH format
 *
 * A WAH is a sequence of chunks each one composed of two parts:
 * - a header of two words with:
 *   - a bit value (0 or 1)
 *   - the number M of successive words with that bit value (called a run)
 *   - the number N of following words that were not compressed
 * - N uncompressed words.
 *
 * As a consequence, each chunk encodes M + N words in 2 + N words. This means
 * the maximum overhead of the WAH is when M is zero, in which case, the
 * overhead is 2 words (8 bytes). As a consequence, it is always at least as
 * efficient as an uncompressed stored in term of memory usage.
 *
 * It's Hybrid because it contains both compressed and uncompressed data, and
 * aligned since everything is done at the work level: the header only
 * references a integral number of words of 32 bits.
 *
 *
 * \section usage Use cases
 *
 * A WAH does not support efficient random accesses (reading / writing at a
 * specific bit position) because the chunks encode a variable amount of words
 * in a variable amount of memory. However, it efficiently support both
 * sequential reading / writing.
 *
 * Bitwise operations are also supported but, with the exception of the
 * negation operator, they are not in place (they always require either a
 * brand new bitmap or a copy of one of the operands). Those operations are
 * efficient since they can deal with long runs with a single word read.
